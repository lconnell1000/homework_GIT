# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## The Project

For this project we had to fix and tidy up some code that we were given for both a html file and a CSS file. The main onject was to make the webpage display according to accessibility standards and that was easy to navigate with clean code. The HTML had to include semantic elements, with the elements following a logical structure. The images needed relebant "alt" attributes added and the heading attributes needed to fall in sequential order. We also added a title element with a descriptie, consise title.
